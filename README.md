# BNKCOD

[Chuck Hutchins](https://blog.hutchins1.net/) discovered an old EPROM marked `BNKCOD` in the UD11 option ROM socket of a Commodore SuperPET.  This is a disassembly of that EPROM.

## Credits

The original author of BNKCOD is unknown.  The EPROM contained no strings.

To make this disassembly, I ran [`m740dasm`](https://github.com/mnaberez/m740dasm) on the original binary and then added symbols and comments.
